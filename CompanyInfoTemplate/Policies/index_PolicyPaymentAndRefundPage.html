<h1>Payment/Refund Policy for Onstitute</h1>
<h2> Purpose </h2>
                <p>
                  The purpose of this Pricing and Refund Policy notice is to describe how Onstitute, our subsidiaries, and our international branches, ("Onstitute" "us," "we," or "our") collect payments for our paid services. Please note that our policies differ between subscription payments and one-time payments made for asynchronous courses, synchronous courses, certification, specialization, and guided project purchases, and that payment options may vary from one offering to another. Please also note that we treat violations of our Terms of Use and Honor Code very seriously, and we have no obligation to offer refunds to users who violate these or other Onstitute policies, even if their requests are made within the designated refund period. Similarly, we have no obligation to offer late refunds to users who do not receive a passing mark in a Course Offering to get a certificate, or who are otherwise unsatisfied with their final grades.
                </p>

              <h2>Payment policy for Onstitute Services</h2>
                  <p>
                    Onstitute offers paid Services (e.g., live synchronous lectures, course certificates for certain courses, etc. among others) for a fee. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in in INR or USD. You are responsible for paying all fees charged by or for Onstitute and applicable taxes in a timely manner with a payment mechanism associated with the applicable paid Services. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees using other collection mechanisms. Refunds may be available for paid Services as described in our Refund Policy below.
                    The details of the payment for our services would be explicitly explained to you before your confirmation to hire us and the same will be mentioned on the product page. The details of our services (e.g., course syllabus, instructor details, etc. among others) that you wish to avail will also be given to you. You are liable to make payments on time, failure of which could lead to a penalty and termination of services. Any balance/outstanding payment has to be cleared within the first 2 days of the service start date failing which services will be considered as closed.
                    <br>For live synchronous lecture-based services, you must pay the fees before the second live session starts. Failure to do so, you may be evicted from, or prevented to join from the live lecture session.
                    <br><br> Fees may vary based on the customer's location, type, and other factors, and Onstitute reserves the right to change any fees at any time at its sole discretion. Any change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting through the relevant Services.
                    <br><br> Please note that, the payments referred to in these clause are with respect to the services rendered by us and only us.
                  </p>

                <h2> Payment Policy for External (Third party) Services Hosted by Onstitute</h2>
                  <p>
                    Onstitute works with several external entites and third parties to offer their education services to the community either free-of-cost or for a fee based on the nature and impact of the service. The details of the service including the name of the external entity or third party (refered as 'original service provider' from here on), fees, etc. will be disclosed in the particular webpage dedicated for that service. Unless otherwise mentioned explicitly in that web page, Onstitute is not responsible for any payment-related disputes in such cases. The end-user must settle it by negotiating directly with the original service provider.
                  </p>

                <h2>Refund Policy for Onstitute Services</h2>
                  <p>
                    <b>For One-time, Online, Asynchronous (Recorded Video) Course and Specialization Purchases</b>
                      <br>1. If you cancel your paid enrollment for an online, asynchronous (recorded video) course, Onstitute will offer you a complete refund until 10 days after payment, or until you have earned your course certificate, whichever is earlier. If you pre-enroll and pay for a course, Onstitute will offer you a complete refund until 10 days after the course launches or until you have earned your course certificate, whichever is earlier. For avoidance of doubt, once you have earned a course certificate with your payment, you are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 10 days. If you do not earn your course certificate within 180 days, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the course. However, if you’re taking a course through your company, organization, or a Onstitute sponsored program (e.g. Onstitute for Business, Onstitute for Governments or Organizations, Onstitute for Refugees, or other Onstitute Social Good programs ) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Onstitute is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract or Onstitute is still running a sponsored program. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Onstitute.                      <br> Notwithstanding the foregoing, shorter refund periods may apply to specific courses and specializations (e.g., for courses that are part of certain programs, you will only be eligible for a full refund until seven days after your payment date). In these cases, the shorter period will be stated as part of the sign-up process for the course or specialization.

                    <br><br><b>For Live Synchronous Courses</b>
                    Onstitute offers refunds for payments made for live synchronous lecture-based courses within the first 2 days of the course starts or before the beginning of the second live session whichever comes first. The course completion date will be decided by the instructor of the course and will be disclosed at the course webpage in the beginning of the course. If you do not earn your completion certificate/credit within the course completion period, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for that course again to earn your completion certificate/credit. However, if you’re taking the guided project through your university, company, organization, or Onstitute sponsored program then you can earn your certificate as long as your organization's contract with Onstitute is active and your access and/or invitation has not expired or terminated in accordance with the terms of that contract or Onstitute is still running the sponsored program. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Onstitute. If you have subscribed through a third party marketplace or through a bank account or credit/debit/reward card that restricts our ability to issue refunds (e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store, a bank-account that does not support online banking) please visit the third party marketplace or your bank (or any financial institution using which you made the payment) for information regarding their policies.

                    <br><br><b>Reasons for denied refunds:</b>
                      We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit or deny refund requests in cases where we believe there is refund abuse, including but not limited to the following:
                      <br> 1. A significant portion of the course has been consumed or downloaded by a student before the refund was requested.
                      <br> 2. Multiple refunds have been requested by a student for the same course.
                      <br> 3. Excessive refunds have been requested by a student.
                      <br> 4. Users who have their account reported, banned or course access disabled due to a violation of our Terms or Trust & Safety Guidelines.
                      <br> 5. We do not grant refunds for any subscription services unless otherwise required by applicable law (please see below for more information).
                      <br> 6. For security purpose and to avoid fraud, we issue refunds only through online/electronic mode only to the account (or, card) from which the payment is made. If your bank-(or financial institutes) restricts our ability to issue refunds in this way, your refund may be denied.
                  </p>
